We will analyze a sample dataset of double-stranded DNA force-extension curves, using the approach described in Ref. 1. Along the way, you will learn to load force-extension data into MATLAB, process and visualize it, and fit the eWLC model to the data.</p><!--/introduction--><h2>Contents</h2><div><ul><li><a href="#1">Before You Begin</a></li><li><a href="#2">Loading the Sample Data</a></li><li><a href="#3">Plotting Data</a></li><li><a href="#5">Metadata</a></li><li><a href="#8">Simple Data Corrections</a></li><li><a href="#12">Basic Fitting</a></li><li><a href="#15">Collections of Data</a></li><li><a href="#22">Twistable Worm-Like Chain Analysis</a></li><li><a href="#26">REFERENCES</a></li></ul></div><h2>Before You Begin<a name="1"></a></h2><p>Make sure MATLAB's "Current Folder" is set to the folder containing the FDFIT package. That should be the folder containing a script called "init.m", as well as a bunch of subfolders.</p><p>Before you start, you should run the <tt>init</tt> script. This adds all the subfolders to MATLAB's <a href="matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'matlab/search-path.html'))">search path</a>, so MATLAB can find all the functions in the package. (Of course, it's also possible to do this yourself using MATLAB's user interface.)</p><pre class="codeinput">init;
</pre><h2>Loading the Sample Data<a name="2"></a></h2><p>The FDFIT package contains functions for loading force-extension data from various sources, including text files (CSV, ASCII, etc.). Let's load some sample data for double-stranded DNA, which has been included with this code.</p><p>Note that all functions in this package are documented. See, for example, the documentation of the <a href="matlab:doc('readasciifile')">readasciifile</a> function used below.</p><pre class="codeinput">fd = readasciifile(<span class="string">'Doc/SampleData/Sample01.csv'</span>, <span class="string">'HeaderLines'</span>, 6);
</pre><h2>Plotting Data<a name="3"></a></h2><p>The <tt>fd</tt> variable we've just created contains our F,d (force-distance) data. Let's have a look at it:</p><pre class="codeinput">plotfd(fd);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Tutorial_01.png" alt=""> <p><a href="matlab:doc('plotfd')">plotfd</a> supports various styles of plotting. For example, we can also plot the data as a pair of F,t and d,t graphs:</p><pre class="codeinput">plotfd(fd, <span class="string">'style'</span>, <span class="string">'fdt'</span>);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Tutorial_02.png" alt=""> <h2>Metadata<a name="5"></a></h2><p>The <tt>fd</tt> variable containing our data is a MATLAB <i>object</i>. In case you're not familiar with object-oriented programming: an object is similar to a <tt>struct</tt>, with a touch of added magic: besides just fields, the object can also contain associated functions.</p><p>Let's have a closer look at the contents of <tt>fd</tt>:</p><pre class="codeinput">disp(fd)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">[ FD DATA OBJECT ]
|--- Name:     Sample01
|--- Metadata: ...
</pre><p>There isn't a lot to see, but your eye might be caught by the line "Metadata". As a matter of fact, <tt>FdData</tt> objects can keep track of simple metadata. For data from ASCII files, this isn't a lot, but we'll encounter some other examples where this is more useful.</p><p>To show the metadata in its full glory, use:</p><pre class="codeinput">disp(fd, <span class="string">'full'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">[ FD DATA OBJECT ]
|--- Name:     Sample01
|--- Metadata: 
|    |--- originalFile             : Doc/SampleData/Sample01.csv
|    |--- headerLines{}            :
|    |                               # Lambda phage dsDNA (48.5 kb)

</pre><p>As you can see, the object contains, in its metadata, the original location the file was read from; as well as the header lines. This metadata was placed there by the <tt>readasciifile</tt> function.</p><h2>Simple Data Corrections<a name="8"></a></h2><p>Now, while plotting the data, we have noticed that the distance values are off. Lambda DNA should have a contour length of 16.5 um, but judging from the F,d plot, it's more like 19.5 um. Looking back at the metadata, we can see where this is coming from: the distance values include the bead diameter. We'll have to subtract that.</p><p><tt>FdData</tt> objects contain some useful functions for these kinds of corrections. For example, to fix the bead diameter issue, we can use the <a href="matlab:doc('FdData/shift')">shift</a> function:</p><pre class="codeinput">fd = fd.shift(<span class="string">'d'</span>, -3.05);
figure;
plotfd(fd);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Tutorial_03.png" alt=""> <p>That looks more like it. Note that, if we now look at the <tt>fd</tt> variable again...</p><pre class="codeinput">disp(fd)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">[ FD DATA OBJECT ]
|--- Name:     Sample01
|--- Metadata: ...
|--- History
     |--- shift(d, -3.05)
</pre><p>The new <tt>FdData</tt> object that was returned by the <tt>shift</tt> function has remembered it's the shifted version of the original. Under "History", you see a line <tt>"shift(d, -3.05)"</tt> that wasn't there before.</p><p>This is a useful little feature that should help with taking care of data provenance. All <tt>FdData</tt> functions that manipulate the data will add such a line to the history list, so you can retrace your steps later on. Some of these functions are:</p><div><ul><li><a href="matlab:doc('FdData/shift')">shift</a>: shift the data along a particular   axis, i.e., add a constant offset to a particular column of the data;</li><li><a href="matlab:doc('FdData/subset')">subset</a>: take a subsest of the data, for   example, only the data between 0 and 30 pN, or only the data between 10   and 15 um.</li><li><a href="matlab:doc('FdData/scale')">scale</a>: scale the data, i.e., multiply a   particular column by a scaling factor;</li><li><a href="matlab:doc('FdData/fragment')">fragment</a>: takes a subrange of the data   ? like subindexing an array. Comparable to "subset", but uses data   indices instead of column values.</li></ul></div><p>By the way, it's also possible to use a visual tool to select subsets of the data. Call the <a href="matlab:doc('trimfd')">trimfd</a> function to open a dialog that allows you to select a range of data using two draggable cursor lines:</p><pre>  fd_fragment = trimfd(fd);</pre><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="trimfd.png" alt=""> </p><p><i>The <tt>trimfd</tt> dialog window. Drag the red cursor lines in the right half of the screen to select a subset of the data.</i></p><h2>Basic Fitting<a name="12"></a></h2><p>Of course, the main goal of the package is to fit F,d curves. Let's start by doing a simple Odijk eWLC fit to our sample curve.</p><pre class="codeinput">f = fitfd(fd)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">Only using data up to 30 pN (use the "noTrim" flag to avoid this).

f = 

     General model:
     f(x) = fOdijkInv_f0(x,Lp,Lc,S,F0)
     Coefficients (with 95% confidence bounds):
       Lp =        42.9  (41.2, 44.6)
       Lc =       16.71  (16.69, 16.73)
       S =        1765  (1690, 1840)
       F0 =     -0.2276  (-0.2617, -0.1935)
</pre><p>That's all: if you don't give any other options, this will fit the Odijk extensible worm-like chain [2,3], with a force offset, to all data up to 30 pN. Let's plot the resulting fit:</p><pre class="codeinput">plotfdfit(fd, f);
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="Tutorial_04.png" alt=""> <p>The <a href="matlab:doc('fitfd')">fitfd</a> function has quite a number of options (see the documentation for details). As one example, we could try fitting a slightly different fit model, and explicitly give the starting values for the fit parameters. Here, we'll use a model that includes an additional 'distance offset' parameter, so we allow for possible variations in bead diameter (i.e., horizontal shifts of the curve). In this case, we'll also have to provide the expected contour length (<tt>Lc</tt>), with respect to which the distance offset is measured.</p><pre class="codeinput">f = fitfd(fd, <span class="string">'model'</span>, <span class="string">'odijk-d0-f0'</span>, <span class="string">'startParams'</span>, [50 1500 0 0], <span class="string">'Lc'</span>, 16.5)

</pre><h2>Collections of Data<a name="15"></a></h2><p>Now you know some of the basic commands, we can turn to one of the more powerful features of the package: managing collections of data.</p><p>We can load groups of <tt>FdData</tt> objects into an 'array', called an <tt>FdDataCollection</tt> (another type of object). Using these collections, we can easily explore the data, apply corrections on groups as a whole, and do global fits.</p><p>Let's start by loading <i>all</i> sample data curves into one of these collections. Oh, and while we're at it, let's not forget to correct for those bead diameters:</p><pre class="codeinput">collection = readasciifolder(<span class="string">'Doc/SampleData/*.csv'</span>, <span class="string">'HeaderLines'</span>, 6, <span class="keyword">...</span>

##### SOURCE BEGIN #####
%% FDFIT TUTORIAL
% This tutorial will guide you through the basic functionality of the
% FDFIT package. We will analyze a sample dataset of double-stranded DNA
% force-extension curves, using the approach described in Ref. 1. Along the
% way, you will learn to load force-extension data into MATLAB, process and 
% visualize it, and fit the eWLC model to the data.

%% Before You Begin
% Make sure MATLAB's "Current Folder" is set to the folder containing the
% FDFIT package. That should be the folder containing a script called
% "init.m", as well as a bunch of subfolders.
% 
% Before you start, you should run the |init| script. This adds all the
% subfolders to MATLAB's 
% <matlab:web(fullfile(docroot,'matlab/search-path.html')) search path>, so
% MATLAB can find all the functions in the package.
% (Of course, it's also possible to do this yourself using MATLAB's user
% interface.)

init;


%% Loading the Sample Data
% The FDFIT package contains functions for loading force-extension data
% from various sources, including text files (CSV, ASCII, etc.). Let's load
% some sample data for double-stranded DNA, which has been included with
% this code.
%
% Note that all functions in this package are documented. See, for example,
% the documentation of the <matlab:doc('readasciifile') readasciifile>
% function used below.

fd = readasciifile('Doc/SampleData/Sample01.csv', 'HeaderLines', 6);


%% Plotting Data
% The |fd| variable we've just created contains our F,d (force-distance) 
% data. Let's have a look at it:

plotfd(fd);

%%
% <matlab:doc('plotfd') plotfd> supports various styles of plotting. For
% example, we can also plot the data as a pair of F,t and d,t graphs:

plotfd(fd, 'style', 'fdt');


%% Metadata
% The |fd| variable containing our data is a MATLAB _object_. In case
% you're not familiar with object-oriented programming: an object is
% similar to a |struct|, with a touch of added magic: besides just fields,
% the object can also contain associated functions.
%
% Let's have a closer look at the contents of |fd|:

disp(fd)

%%
% There isn't a lot to see, but your eye might be caught by the line
% "Metadata". As a matter of fact, |FdData| objects can keep track of
% simple metadata. For data from ASCII files, this isn't a lot, but we'll
% encounter some other examples where this is more useful.
%
% To show the metadata in its full glory, use:

disp(fd, 'full')

%%
% As you can see, the object contains, in its metadata, the original
% location the file was read from; as well as the header lines. This
% metadata was placed there by the |readasciifile| function.


%% Simple Data Corrections
% Now, while plotting the data, we have noticed that the distance values
% are off. Lambda DNA should have a contour length of 16.5 um, but judging
% from the F,d plot, it's more like 19.5 um. Looking back at the metadata,
% we can see where this is coming from: the distance values include the
% bead diameter. We'll have to subtract that.
%
% |FdData| objects contain some useful functions for these kinds of
% corrections. For example, to fix the bead diameter issue, we can use the
% <matlab:doc('FdData/shift') shift> function:

fd = fd.shift('d', -3.05);
figure;
plotfd(fd);

%%
% That looks more like it. Note that, if we now look at the |fd| variable
% again...

disp(fd)

%%
% The new |FdData| object that was returned by the |shift| function
% has remembered it's the shifted version of the original. Under
% "History", you see a line |"shift(d, -3.05)"| that wasn't there before.
%
% This is a useful little feature that should help with taking care of data
% provenance. All |FdData| functions that manipulate the data will add such
% a line to the history list, so you can retrace your steps later on. Some
% of these functions are:
%
% * <matlab:doc('FdData/shift') shift>: shift the data along a particular
%   axis, i.e., add a constant offset to a particular column of the data;
% * <matlab:doc('FdData/subset') subset>: take a subsest of the data, for
%   example, only the data between 0 and 30 pN, or only the data between 10
%   and 15 um.
% * <matlab:doc('FdData/scale') scale>: scale the data, i.e., multiply a
%   particular column by a scaling factor;
% * <matlab:doc('FdData/fragment') fragment>: takes a subrange of the data
%   ? like subindexing an array. Comparable to "subset", but uses data
%   indices instead of column values.

%%
% By the way, it's also possible to use a visual tool to select subsets of
% the data. Call the <matlab:doc('trimfd') trimfd> function to open a
% dialog that allows you to select a range of data using two draggable
% cursor lines:
%
%    fd_fragment = trimfd(fd);
%
% <<trimfd.png>>
%
% _The |trimfd| dialog window. Drag the red cursor lines in the right half
% of the screen to select a subset of the data._


%% Basic Fitting
% Of course, the main goal of the package is to fit F,d curves. Let's start
% by doing a simple Odijk eWLC fit to our sample curve.

f = fitfd(fd)

%%
% That's all: if you don't give any other options, this will fit the Odijk
% extensible worm-like chain [2,3], with a force offset, to all data up to 30
% pN. Let's plot the resulting fit:

plotfdfit(fd, f);

%%
% The <matlab:doc('fitfd') fitfd> function has quite a number of options
% (see the documentation for details). As one example, we could try fitting
% a slightly different fit model, and explicitly give the starting values
% for the fit parameters. Here, we'll use a model that includes an
% additional 'distance offset' parameter, so we allow for possible
% variations in bead diameter (i.e., horizontal shifts of the curve). In
% this case, we'll also have to provide the expected contour length (|Lc|),
% with respect to which the distance offset is measured.

f = fitfd(fd, 'model', 'odijk-d0-f0', 'startParams', [50 1500 0 0], 'Lc', 16.5)



%% Collections of Data
% Now you know some of the basic commands, we can turn to one of the more
% powerful features of the package: managing collections of data.
%
% We can load groups of |FdData| objects into an 'array', called an
% |FdDataCollection| (another type of object). Using these collections, we
% can easily explore the data, apply corrections on groups as a whole, and
% do global fits.
%
% Let's start by loading _all_ sample data curves into one of these
% collections. Oh, and while we're at it, let's not forget to correct for
% those bead diameters:

collection = readasciifolder('Doc/SampleData/*.csv', 'HeaderLines', 6, ...
    'beadDiameter', 3.05);

%%
% As before, we can use the |disp| function to peek inside:

disp(collection)

%%
% And we can also plot the data:

figure;
plotfd(collection);


%%
% Once we have data in a collection, there is also a simple user interface
% we can bring up to browse the data:
%
%    explorefd(collection);
% 
% <<FdExplorer.png>>
%
% In this window, there's a few nifty features:
%
% * You can plot multiple graphs simultaneously, by holding down the Ctrl key
%   (or the Cmd key on the Mac), and clicking in the data list on the
%   left-hand side.
% * The buttons in the top right corner allow you to visually trim the
%   selected data files (using the window with red cursors you've seen
%   before), and to remove files you don't like from the collection.
% * You can _tag_ data curves. Each curve in the collection can have one or
%   more associated tags, similar to the tags you may have encountered on
%   websites like Gmail. You can, for example, give all curves that were
%   measured in the presence of protein a tag |protein|. Later on, you can
%   then extract those protein curve using the command:
%
%     collection.getByTag('protein')
%
% This will give you a new collection containing just the F,d curves that
% have the |protein| tag.
%
% * The window also allows you to filter by tags, using the controls in the
%   bottom-left corner.

%%
% Collections are great, since they allow you to easily manipulate multiple
% datasets at once. For example, we can fit all the curvecs in one go, and
% then browse through the individual fit results:
%
%     fits = fitfd(collection);
%     explorefdfits(fits);
%
% In the _Cell Explorer_ that pops up, you can use the arrow, PgUp and PgDn
% keys on your keyboard to look at the fits we just made.

%%
% Most importantly, having data in a collection allows you to use the
% _global fitting_ technique described in the paper [1]. Simply run:

gfit = fitfdglobal(collection, 'Lc', 16.5)

%%
% If you want to inspect the fit results, use:
%
%     plotglobalfdfits(collection, gfit);



%% Twistable Worm-Like Chain Analysis
% The twistable worm-like chain (tWLC) analysis has been implemented as an
% object <matlab:doc('TwlcAnalysis') TwlcAnalysis>. To run a tWLC analysis
% on our sample data, follow these steps:

twa = TwlcAnalysis('data', collection, 'nBootstrapIter', 4)

%%
% This creates a TwlcAnalysis object, that will run all the steps described
% in the paper [1]. We'll decrease the number of bootstrap iterations for
% now, but for an actual analysis, you should probably keep this to the
% default setting of 100.
%
% For a precise description of all the parameters, I'll have to refer you
% to the paper [1], its Supplementary Information, as well as the
% <matlab:doc('TwlcAnalysis') TwlcAnalysis documentation>.
%
% As the output already indicates, we should now call the "analyze"
% function to run the actual analysis:

twa.analyze();

%%
% Plotting the fit:

twa.plotFit();

%%
% Usually, it's also a good idea to inspect the sweep results. You can do
% this using the <matlab:doc('TwlcAnalysis/plotSweeps') plotSweeps>
% function:

twa.plotSweeps();
